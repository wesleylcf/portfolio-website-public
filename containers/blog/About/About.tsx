            <p>
              My name is Wesley and I'm 21 this year. I'm currently pursuing
              Computer Science at the Nanyang Technological
              Unviersity(2021-2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              I picked up programming as I was influenced by my siblings, and
              while serving National Service, I took a bunch of courses in a
              breadth-first manner to find a direction that I could work
              towards.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I'm inclined towards Web development, and spend my free
              time doing projects that I find interesting or provide insight.

              In the future, I hope to be able to work in a software-centric
              company as I feel that the scale and quality of the code would be
              something that I could learn alot from.
